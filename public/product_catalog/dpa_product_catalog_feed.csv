	Detox
		Natural Hair Cleanser
For All Hair Types
&nbsp;
Often, harsh soaps and shampoos strip hair and skin of their natural oils, leaving you feeling dry all over. NuLengths Detox Natural Hair Cleanser rinse helps to counteract the damage caused by balancing your hair and scalp's natural pH levels.

	NuLengths Detox Natural Hair Cleanser rinse will help to remove scaly build-up and residue from the hair shaft and close the hair cuticle. Since hair has a naturally low (slightly acidic) pH, our Natural Cleanser rinse will help close the hair cuticle and lock in moisture and protein.
	
	NuLengths Natural Cleanser Rinse will…
	
		Nourish hair
		Regulate PH
		Moisturise scalp and hair strands
		Prevent hair from shedding
		Promote blood circulation on the scalp
		Aid in hair growth
		Treat dry scalp, fungi, and bacteria
	
	
		When the cuticle is in good shape, is unbroken, and lies flat, your hair has a smooth appearance. When the layers of the cuticle are tightly knit together, the light is able to reflect off the cuticle, creating tangle-free hair that shines. The cuticle opens when we shampoo our hair.
		
		When the cuticle layers are open and not knit together, the hair will feel rough, coarse and brittle. The hair will absorb the light rather than reflect it, which gives the appearance of dull and lifeless hair. NuLengths Detox Natural Hair Cleanser  works as a natural detangler and has a tonic action that promotes blood circulation in the small capillaries that irrigate the skin.
	When used regularly in your natural hair care routine, NuLengths Detox Natural Hair Cleanser will revitalise your hair, leaving it soft and smooth.

Fortunately correcting dietary shortage of this key anti-ageing substance is as simple as
taking a high quality supplement like Health Matrix Omega-3.
The two types of fatty acids contained in Omega-3, Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play an important role in preventing and managing
cardiovascular disease. Research has shown that they are beneficial in:
• Supporting the normal functioning of the heart
• Reducing the risk of stroke and heart attacks
• Lowering blood fats like triglycerides and cholesterol
In addition the researched benefits of taking a scientifically determined daily dose of
Omega-3 also extend to:
• Assisting the recovery from intestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome
• Maintenance of normal brain function, vision and bone health
• Supporting mood stability
• Improving recovery after exercise.

The multi award-winning Original Iron delivers exceptional results, thanks to our renowned temperature controlled, mineral-coated ceramic plates.
The innovative temperature control feature of this multi&nbsp;
	award winning&nbsp;iron allows you to choose from five different temperatures, ensuring optimum performance for all hair types.
The floating, mineral-coated ceramic plates are proven to be kinder to hair, leaving it feeling conditioned and cared for.
The Cloud Nine Original Iron comes with a one-year manufacturer’s warranty. Simply register your product to activate.
&nbsp;
TEMPERATURE CONTROL
With a total of five temperature control options, you will be able to set the iron from 100 degrees to 200 degrees, so you can choose the heat that’s best suited to your hair type.

HEAT UP TIME
The Original Iron takes 20 seconds to reach maximum temperature.
PLATES
The ultra-smooth, mineral-infused ceramic surfaces of our Irons allow you to achieve incredible styling results at much lower, hair friendly temperatures. Floating plates on our style &amp; straight irons also cushion the impact throughout each section of your hair, minimising dragging or pinches.
THE PLUG
&nbsp;
The Original Iron also features a European plug which is concealed inside the UK plug. This means that you can take your styling tools with you wherever you and are never left without the perfect style accessory.
INTERNATIONAL VOLTAGE
The Original Iron features international voltage meaning that the Iron will automatically adjust itself to the varying power source ranging from 100v-240v, 50Hz ac.
PROTECTIVE HEAT GUARD
The protective heat guard is more than just a style accessory. In addition to protecting your styling tools in a tidy package, the guard also protects your surfaces and carpets from unnecessary damage. By ensuring you keep your product in its protective guard, you prepare for a long and rewarding styling partnership!
STRAIGHTENERS THAT THINK!
Cloud Nine tools are equipped with a MiCOM (MicroComputer) controlled heating system. Our irons actually ‘think’ for themselves, adjusting&nbsp;
	the temperature&nbsp;according to the thermal sensor’s calculations. MiCom control is combined with Ceramic Heat Element technology found in all Cloud Nine styling tools to ensure a completely even temperature across the entire super-smooth, mineral-infused, ceramic surface.
